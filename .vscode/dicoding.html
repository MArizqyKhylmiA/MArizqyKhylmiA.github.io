                        <h2>history</h2>
                        <p>Kawasaki Aircraft initially manufactured motorcycles under the Meguro name, having bought an
                            ailing motorcycle manufacturer, Meguro Manufacturing with whom they had been in partnership.
                            This eventually became Kawasaki Motor Sales. Some early motorcycles display an emblem with
                            "Kawasaki Aircraft" on the fuel tank.
                            During 1962, Kawasaki engineers were developing a four-stroke engine for small cars. Then
                            some
                            of the engineers transferred to the Meguro factory to work on the Meguro K1 and the SG, a
                            single
                            cylinder 250 cc OHV. In 1963, Kawasaki and Meguro merged to form Kawasaki Motorcycle
                            Co.,Ltd.
                            Kawasaki motorcycles from 1962 through 1967 used an emblem which can be described as a flag
                            within a wing.

                        <p>Born in Kagoshima to a kimono merchant, Kawasaki Shōzō became a tradesman at the age of 17 in
                            Nagasaki, the only place in Japan then open to the West. He started a shipping business in
                            Osaka at 27, which failed when his cargo ship sank during a storm. In 1869, he joined a
                            company handling sugar from the Ryukyu Islands, established by a Kagoshima samurai, and in
                            1893, researched Ryukyu sugar and sea routes to the Ryukyus at the request of the Ministry
                            of Finance. In 1894, he was appointed executive vice president of Japan Mail Steam-Powered
                            Shipping Company, and succeeded in opening a sea route to the Ryukyu and transporting sugar
                            to mainland Japan.</p>
